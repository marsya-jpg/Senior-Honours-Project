# Senior-Honours-Project

Codes and textfiles of project on analysing various galaxy hydrodynamical simulations; EAGLE, SIMBA and Illustris. 
The cosmic stellar mass parameter \Omega_* was investigated; simulations claimed to match observational galaxy stellar mass function.

Omega_z.ipynb -- plots of \Omega_z from simulation data of total stellar mass at each redshift
xxx_omega_output.txt -- textfile of final \Omega_z values where xxx is simulation
gsmf.ipynb -- plots of gsmf and calculation of \Omega_z from various sources of physical gsmf
